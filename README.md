# 311-Complaints
Optimize Parking Regulations using 311 Complaints.

Introduction:


Each day, nyc311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, drug activity and side street conditions. Among these complaints, illegal parking is a critical issue for NYC because itâ€™s up to 146,240 complaints in 2017 and it can lead to multiple more severe problems around life in NYC, such as traffic jams or safety issues. We can easily find it when we walk around NYC. Therefore, we think people should attach importance to this problem and it is worth studying the problem. As the NYC parking rules, blocking the driveway, double parking, parking at a bus stop or hydrant or bike line are all in the scope of illegal parking.

Another reason that we want to study illegal parking in NYC is that We are interested in illegal parking from distinct dimensions such as location, time, day, and context. We will analyze this way to try to figure out the root reason of illegal parking and whether the parking lot resource is tight in NYC. Ultimately our goal is to optimize the parking rules to fit the parking demands.
